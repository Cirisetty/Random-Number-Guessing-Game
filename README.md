# Random-Number-Guessing-Game
It's a simple game developed using python .It is a python program based game which is created for the purpose of
entertainment.This python program contain basics of python such as user
input, while condition, if- else condition.Basic logic behind the game is that
system will ask about the numbers and according to the number is entered
by the user it will gives output such as ‘Too low’ or ‘Too High’ and when the
number is get correct it will show output as ‘‘you guessed it right!’. And this
number will be random and will depend on the random function which is
used in the python program.

# INTRODUCTION :-
In this game the computer chooses a random number between 1 and
15 , and the player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as
possible. Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells him
whether the guess is too high, too low, or right. Once the player guesses
the number, the game is over.

# OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT :-
The objective of this project is to let the students apply the
programming knowledge into a real- world situation/problem and exposed
the students how programming skills helps in developing a good software.
1. Write programs utilizing modern software tools.
2. Apply object oriented programming principles effectively when
developing small to medium sized projects.
3. Write effective procedural code to solve small to medium sized
problems.
4. Students will demonstrate a breadth of knowledge in computer science,
as exemplified in the areas of systems, theory and software development.
5. Students will demonstrate ability to conduct a research or applied
Computer Science project, requiring writing and presentation skills which
exemplify scholarly style in computer science.
